Rental Tracker is app that allows me to store rental property data in the Denver area. Instead of trying to keep track of rentals, their price, pros and cons, deposit amount, number of roommates, etc, I am building my own full stack app to help me out.

I'm using mongoDB as the database, node.js and Express on the server, and React and Redux on the frontend.
